The Volkswagen Automotive Cloud (VW.AC) empowers product development teams to build powerful, cloud-based applications and services, and to easily turn massive amounts of data into unique value for customers. 

VW.AC delivers the following capabilities and more:

- Ingest, process, and store mobility data
- Manage vehicles, users, and services
- Enable first-party and third-party custom applications and services
- Visualize and analyze telemetry data
- Train and manage machine learning models
- Build, test, and deploy applications and services using an integrated set of tools and resources
- Interact with a community of like-minded connected vehicle developers


## REST-Based APIs

Vehicle provisioning and data management is performed almost exclusively by making calls to VW.AC APIs. All APIs are REST-based and easy to learn.

VW.AC API products include:

- Data Storage and Data Management
- Data Platform Workbenches
- Extension Management
- Event Notification
- Vehicle and Device Management
- User and Claim Management
- Service Management
- Command Management


## Benefits of the VW.AC Platform

### Build a virtual Connected Vehicle

The VW.AC Platform APIs are used to build a digital representation of your connected vehicle, its onboard devices, and its associated users. Once built, the APIs are used to define, configure, and manage the services and capabilities provided by the vehicle's devices and to assign roles and permission to the vehicle's users.

The VW.AC Platform can then be used to send commands to the vehicle (Cloud-to-Device, or C2D) and instruct devices to send responses, data, and/or telemetry back to the VW.AC Platform (Device-to-Cloud, or D2C). The data is stored by the VW.AC Platform and can be viewed, retrieved, and analyzed.

Use cases might be as simple as a vehicle's owner using a smartphone app to "lock the doors," "close the sunroof," or "send an alert when the battery is charged to 80%." Or more complex interactions such as granting a service technician permission to remotely extract diagnostics and vehicle telemetry over several days to help troubleshoot a difficult repair issue.

The Volkswagen Automotive Cloud provides a broad and flexible platform, enabling developers to create a variety of applications and services that benefit owners, fleet managers, dealers, manufacturers, service departments, and other third parties.

### Benefits and use cases

Examples of the capabilities and benefits that can be created with the VW.AC Platform:

#### Individual owners

- Use an in-dash display to pay for parking when arriving at a parking meter or car park.
- View and order food from a "to-go" menu when arriving at a restaurant's curb side.
- Receive an alert on your smartphone if a parking valet takes your vehicle outside of a specific geofenced area.
- Use a smartphone app to control every aspect of your vehicle: unlock doors, close windows, remote ignition start, remote climate control, etc.
- Collect and analyze "Track day" telemetry data with an AI-inspired "expert analyst" to provide guidance on brake points and acceleration curves.

#### Fleet managers

- Enable on-demand door lock and ignition control to new renters/leasers.
- Monitor speed, area travelled in, extreme braking incidents, and exact mileage to ensure rental cars are not abused or taken outside of prescribed regions.
- Location tracking, health monitoring, usage reporting, and service notifications for vehicle fleets.

#### Dealers and manufacturers

- Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates.
- Custom applications, upgrades, and add-ons for in-dash infotainment systems.
- Service reminders, appointment scheduling, service bulletins, recall notifications, and dynamic wear-and-tear monitoring and alerts.
- Electric Vehicle (EV) services such as: battery performance, long-distance trip planning, recommended charging stations, and recharge notifications.

#### Third party services

- Monitor acceleration, braking, speed limits, and miles traveled for enhanced insurance offerings.


## Authorization and Security

All of the use cases above require that individual users have been properly authenticated and granted the necessary access rights and privileges. And that the vehicle owners and drivers have accepted the required terms and conditions and given their consent for: telemetry collection, usage and data retention, execution of commands, and installation of updates.

To support this, the services within the Volkswagen Automotive Cloud are fortified by a robust set of access controls and authorization mechanisms which ensure security and privacy, enforce permissions, and maintain conformance to regional and legal requirements.


## Overview and Next Steps

In the following pages you will find articles on key concepts and several introductory tutorials which will introduce developers to the fundamental building blocks of the VW.AC Platform. 

You will learn about the Platform and use its APIs to create a virtual representation of a connected vehicle, including:

- Register a vehicle
- Add in-vehicle devices
- Create a user
- Define the permissions needed for a user to command and control a vehicle (claims)

Additional articles will guide you through creating and deploying your own applications to send commands to, and receive telemetry and data from, your vehicle.
